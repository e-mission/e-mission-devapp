This file lists the module dependencies for the project and their licenses.

As documented in the README, this entire project is derived from the phonegap-devapp project. The javascript code in this project is minimal, and this project has not added any new dependencies. The original javascript dependencies, added under an Apache 2.0 license, still apply.

The main modification is to the list of plugins. The original project contains a set of plugins chosen by the phonegap developers. This project contains the e-mission-phone plugins and a few additional plugins required for the live updates.

### Cordova plugins not in the phone app, installed automatically
